# OpenGL + OpenCV Video Processing App

This project demonstrates real-time video processing using **OpenCV** and **OpenGL** with both **CPU** and **GPU** filtering and transformation modes.


## Building the Project in VS Code

1. **Open the project folder** in VS Code.

2. **Open the command palette**:
   - Press **`Ctrl + Shift + P`** (or **`Cmd + Shift + P`** on macOS).

3. **Run CMake configuration**:
   - Type and select **`CMake: Configure`**.
   - When prompted for a kit, choose
